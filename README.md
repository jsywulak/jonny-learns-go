# jonny-learns-go

my attempt to work through [go by example](https://gobyexample.com/) but using asserts ([using testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)) instead of printlns and [test && commit || revert](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864) instead of just keeping this on my slowly dying laptop (which is why there are a bajillion commits)
